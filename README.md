- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) 


### What I learned

I realized at the last moment the hover in the image, so in the first versions it is not there, let's see if the Zero of tomorrow adds it.


and now random thoughts what i have of my code:


I don't know if I have to use articles or something different in this part and not spam divs

```html
<div class="main-title">
    <h2><a href="#">Equilibrium #3429</a></h2>
    <p>Our Equilibrium collection promotes balance and calm.</p>
</div>

<div class="main-info">
    <p class="main-info__price"><span class="etherium"></span> 0.041 ETH</p>
    <p ><span class="clock"></span> 3 days left</p>
</div>


<div class="main-creator">
    <img src="./images/image-avatar.png" alt="Avatar">
    <p>Creation of <a href="#">Jules Wyvern</a></p>
</div>

<footer class="attribution">
    Challenge by <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io?ref=challenge" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor</a>. 
    Coded by <a href="#">ZeroBl</a>.
</footer>
```


  I Need use this more, is so useful

```css
.wrapper{
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    height: 100%;
}
```


### Continued development

I must try to learn to program faster, I think I have taken too long in this simple problem, although everyone goes at their own pace. in addition to not forgetting that I am using Git for something, although in this problem it was not necessary.
